# MIST (Enigma)
## Home of MIST Computing. Work in progress.
## Currently working on: Enigma.Crimson (v0.0.1)

MIST Computing is a long-term project aimed at bringing the power of distributed computing to everyday developers. Today, as always, our ideas for what computers can do far exceed the capability of modern hardware. This means that developers who are new to the game or developers without the means of large companies are often forced out of the bidding to explore new software technology.

What MIST Computing aims to do is alleviate this road block to innovation in software. MIST is a modular distributed computing system that is easy to use and implement.
